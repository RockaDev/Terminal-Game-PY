# Terminal-Game-PY

Its basically just a small game, i worked on this 2 hours straight. Its not even half finished. I added XP, Levels, Money, XP Farming, Killing Monsters, Limitations,
Unlimited Levels. Its not balanced yet, i will work on this when ill be bored. This is just like a layout, Im plannig to make a graphical game which will be like
this, but in 2d.

Feel free to learn something. I know the code isnt the best but it was hard to make it work together.
